# Analyzing Deep Percolation Dynamics: A Lysimeter-Based Study In A Cold Environment

## Overview
<p>
This repository contains the scripts (IPython notebooks) used in a manuscript titled
"Analyzing Deep Percolation Dynamics: A Lysimeter-Based Study In A Cold Environment".

It includes the following scripts:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> `event_identification.ipynb`: A notebook used to identify percolation events using the lysimeter data. </li>
    <li> `analysis.ipynb`: A notebook used to analyze the percolation events and plot the results. </li>
    <li> `user_functions.py`: A Python script containing the functions used in the notebooks. </li>
</ul>
